Here's a comprehensive .gitignore file tailored for Delphi projects. This file helps you exclude compiled binaries, intermediate files, IDE-specific settings, and user-specific configurations that should not be committed to your Git repository.

By using this, you keep your repository clean, prevent unnecessary merge conflicts, and ensure that only essential source code and project definitions are tracked.

# Delphi Project Files to Ignore

# Compiled Binaries
*.exe
*.dll
*.bpl
*.dcp
*.so    # Linux shared object (for FMX Linux)
*.dylib # macOS dynamic library (for FMX macOS)
*.apk   # Android package (for FMX Android)
*.ipa   # iOS package (for FMX iOS)

# Intermediate Files (DCU, OBJ, RES, etc.)
*.dcu
*.dcuil
*.dcuarm
*.dcuosx
*.dcuaarch64
*.obj
*.res
*.o
*.rsm
*.tds   # Debug symbols

# Project Output Folders
# These are the default output folders for different platforms.
# Adjust if you use custom output directories.

# Backup Files
*.~*
*.bak
*.old
*.sbr
*.pch

# IDE-specific / User-specific files
*.identcache
*.local
*.dsk   # Desktop layout
*.opt   # Project options (can be included if shared, but often user-specific)
*.dof   # Project options (older format, often user-specific)
*.bdsproj.user
*.groupproj.user
*.cbl
*.log
*.stat
*.tvs
__history/ # Local history (if enabled)

# DFM/FMX Backup Files (if IDE creates them)
*.dfm~
*.fmx~

# TestRunner Output
TestResults.xml

# Resource files generated by the IDE (if not explicitly managed)
# Some developers prefer to keep these, but they can often be regenerated.
# If you have custom resources, you might want to manage them separately.
*.rc
*.rc2

# PasDoc / Documentation Generation
Docs/
Output/

# Packages and Libraries (if not managed by a package manager like GetIt or manually)
# If you have external libraries that are not part of your source,
# it's usually better to manage them with a dependency manager or as submodules.
# Otherwise, they might be included here.
# For example, if you have a 'lib' folder with compiled third-party components:
# lib/

# Project-specific files you might want to ignore if they are generated
# and not source-controlled (e.g., if you have a build script that generates them)
# ProjectName.dpr.manifest
# ProjectName.dpr.entitlements

# Example of ignoring files in a specific folder (e.g., for a 'build' folder)
# build/

# Ignore .vs (Visual Studio Code) folder if you use VS Code for editing
.vscode/

# Ignore .idea (IntelliJ IDEA/Rider) folder if you use these IDEs
.idea/
